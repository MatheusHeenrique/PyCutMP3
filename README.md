# Welcome to my Python music cutting program!

This program is designed to help you cut your music based on the provided minutes.

You can use the program in two ways:

## Using a text file as input:

To use this method, you need to provide the path to the text file as an argument, for example:

    python main.py -f "C:\path\to\text_file.txt" -a "C:\path\to\music.mp3"

Note that in the text file, minutes should be typed like this: 1:20 2:30. Also, you must give an enter after the last minute, otherwise the program will give an error.

## Using minutes provided directly:

In this case, you will provide the minutes as an argument, for example:

    python main.py -m 0:00 0:10 -a "C:\path\to\music.mp3"

With this, you can cut your music based on the provided minutes.

Thank you for using my program and have fun! If you think you can add something, feel free to do so.
